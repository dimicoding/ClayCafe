## Research of similar businesses

**Market Research on Similar Businesses:**

In my market research conducted in Cologne, I identified Pottery Art Cafe (website: https://www.pottery-art-cafe.de/) as a notable pottery business. To further enhance my marketing strategies, I am conducting a comprehensive analysis of other pottery-related businesses, studios, workshops, and ecommerce stores in the area. This research will help me understand the competition, target audience, pricing, and marketing channels. By leveraging this valuable information, I aim to position my pottery ecommerce shop, Claycafe, effectively and become the preferred choice for pottery enthusiasts in Cologne.
