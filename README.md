Color Palette by [ColorHunt](https://colorhunt.co/)

https://colorate.azurewebsites.net/

https://chat.openai.com/ - Was only used to pre-fill products, workshop, and blog content with text. Title and descriptions were generated by AI.

Navbar adapted from: https://demit-sb.herokuapp.com/ 
/* When the user scrolls down, hide the navbar. When the user scrolls up, show the navbar */

Cohort facilitator's Kay Welfare project: https://chirpy-chooks.herokuapp.com/ , helped me to structurize the manual testing in a more complete way.
